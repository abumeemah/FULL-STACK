# Personal Income Tax Basics (2026)

## Overview
Personal Income Tax (PIT) is a direct tax imposed on the income of individuals in Nigeria. The 2026 tax year brings updated rates and enhanced clarity on different taxpayer categories.

## 2026 Tax Bands
The Nigerian Tax Authority has updated the progressive tax bands for 2026:

- **₦0 - ₦800,000**: 0% (Tax-free allowance)
- **₦800,001 - ₦3,000,000**: 15%
- **₦3,000,001 - ₦12,000,000**: 18%
- **₦12,000,001 - ₦25,000,000**: 21%
- **₦25,000,001 - ₦50,000,000**: 23%
- **Above ₦50,000,000**: 25%

## Who Must Pay PIT?

### 1. Employees
Those earning salaries, wages, or benefits from employment under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system.

### 2. Entrepreneurs
Business owners, sole proprietors, and self-employed individuals who operate businesses.

### 3. Mixed Income Earners
Those with both employment and business income must consider both calculation methods.

## Key Differences: Employee vs Entrepreneur

### Employees (PAYE)
- Tax calculated on gross employment income plus benefits
- Benefits include car allowances (5% of car value) and housing (max 20% of salary)
- Statutory deductions: Pension, NHIS, NHF
- Rent relief available for personal accommodation

### Entrepreneurs
- Tax calculated on net business income after deductible expenses
- Can deduct legitimate business expenses
- Personal statutory contributions separate from business expenses
- Rent relief available for personal accommodation (not business premises)

## Progressive Tax System
Nigeria uses a progressive tax system where higher income levels are taxed at higher rates. This ensures fair taxation based on ability to pay.

## Example Calculation
For someone earning ₦2,500,000 annually:
- First ₦800,000: ₦0 (0%)
- Remaining ₦1,700,000: ₦255,000 (15%)
- **Total Tax**: ₦255,000
- **Effective Rate**: 10.2%

# Employee Tax Guide (PAYE System)

## Understanding Employee Taxation
The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system is used for employees in Nigeria. Your employer deducts tax from your salary based on your total taxable income.

## Components of Taxable Income

### 1. Basic Salary
Your annual gross salary as stated in your employment contract.

### 2. Car Benefit
If your employer provides a car for personal use:
- **Calculation**: 5% of the car's value annually
- **Example**: Car worth ₦2,000,000 = ₦100,000 annual benefit

### 3. Housing Benefit
If your employer provides accommodation:
- **Calculation**: Rental value of accommodation
- **Cap**: Maximum 20% of your annual salary
- **Example**: Salary ₦3,600,000, housing worth ₦1,200,000 = ₦720,000 benefit (20% cap applies)

### 4. Other Benefits
- Meal allowances (if above reasonable limits)
- Transport allowances
- Bonuses and commissions

## Deductions Available

### 1. Statutory Contributions
- **Pension**: Typically 8% of salary (employee contribution)
- **NHIS**: National Health Insurance Scheme contribution
- **NHF**: National Housing Fund (2.5% of salary)

### 2. Rent Relief
- **Rate**: 20% of annual rent paid for personal accommodation
- **Maximum**: ₦500,000 per year
- **Requirement**: Must be for personal residence, not business

### 3. Other Personal Income
Include any additional income from:
- Investments and dividends
- Rental income from personal properties
- Freelance work
- Interest from savings

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Example: Software Developer
- **Annual Salary**: ₦3,600,000
- **Company Car**: ₦2,000,000 (Benefit: ₦100,000)
- **Company Housing**: ₦1,200,000 (Benefit: ₦720,000 - capped at 20%)
- **Investment Income**: ₦300,000
- **Annual Rent Paid**: ₦800,000

**Step 1: Calculate Gross Employment Income**
₦3,600,000 + ₦100,000 + ₦720,000 = ₦4,420,000

**Step 2: Add Other Income**
₦4,420,000 + ₦300,000 = ₦4,720,000

**Step 3: Deduct Statutory Contributions**
- Pension (8%): ₦288,000
- NHIS: ₦18,000
- NHF (2.5%): ₦90,000
- Total: ₦396,000

**Step 4: Deduct Rent Relief**
20% of ₦800,000 = ₦160,000

**Step 5: Calculate Chargeable Income**
₦4,720,000 - ₦396,000 - ₦160,000 = ₦4,164,000

**Step 6: Apply Tax Bands**
- First ₦800,000: ₦0 (0%)
- Next ₦2,200,000: ₦330,000 (15%)
- Remaining ₦1,164,000: ₦209,520 (18%)
- **Total Tax**: ₦539,520

Business expenses reduce your net business income, which in turn reduces your total taxable income for Personal Income Tax purposes. This can result in significant tax savings when properly managed and documented.

Remember: The key to successful expense deduction is maintaining proper records and ensuring all claimed expenses are legitimate, reasonable, and necessary for your business operations.

**Business Travel**: Not taxable if for business purposes
**Personal Transport**: Taxable if above reasonable limits

### 5. Bonuses and Commissions

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Senior Manager
**Basic Details**:
- Annual Salary: ₦4,800,000
- Company Car: ₦3,000,000
- Company House: ₦2,000,000
- Monthly Meal Allowance: ₦40,000

**Benefit Calculations**:
- Car Benefit: ₦150,000 (5% of ₦3,000,000)
- Housing Benefit: ₦960,000 (20% of salary, as house value exceeds this)
- Meal Benefit: ₦180,000 (₦15,000 × 12 months excess over ₦25,000 limit)

**Total Taxable Benefits**: ₦1,290,000
**Total Taxable Income**: ₦4,800,000 + ₦1,290,000 = ₦6,090,000

### Example 2: Mid-Level Employee
**Basic Details**:
- Annual Salary: ₦2,400,000
- Transport Allowance: ₦30,000/month
- Medical Insurance: ₦100,000/year (employer-paid)

**Benefit Calculations**:
- Transport: ₦360,000/year (fully taxable as personal transport)
- Medical: ₦0 (non-taxable benefit)

**Total Taxable Income**: ₦2,400,000 + ₦360,000 = ₦2,760,000

## Impact on Tax Calculation
Benefits increase your taxable income, which may push you into higher tax brackets:

### Without Benefits
- Salary: ₦2,400,000
- Tax: ₦240,000 (15% on amount above ₦800,000)

## Planning Strategies

### For Employees
1. **Understand Your Benefits**: Know which benefits are taxable
2. **Negotiate Wisely**: Consider tax implications when negotiating packages
3. **Maximize Non-Taxable Benefits**: Focus on medical, training, pension contributions

### For Employers
1. **Structure Packages Efficiently**: Balance taxable and non-taxable benefits
2. **Provide Clear Information**: Help employees understand tax implications
3. **Consider Gross-Up**: Adjust salaries to account for benefit taxes
4. **Regular Reviews**: Update benefit structures based on tax changes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

2. Assuming all allowances are non-taxable
3. Not keeping proper records of benefit values
4. Failing to update tax calculations when benefits change
5. Not considering benefit taxes in salary negotiations

# Rent Relief Guide (2026)

## What is Rent Relief?
Rent relief is a tax deduction available to both employees and entrepreneurs for personal accommodation rent paid during the tax year.

## Key Features (2026 Update)

### Rate
**20%** of annual rent paid for personal accommodation

**₦500,000** per tax year (increased awareness and enforcement)

### Eligibility
- Must be for personal residential accommodation
- Cannot be for business premises
- Must have proper documentation
- Available to both employees and entrepreneurs

## Calculation Method

### Formula
Rent Relief = MIN(20% × Annual Rent Paid, ₦500,000)

### Examples

**Example 1: Low Rent**
- Annual Rent: ₦600,000
- Calculation: 20% × ₦600,000 = ₦120,000
- **Relief Claimed**: ₦120,000

**Example 2: High Rent**
- Annual Rent: ₦3,000,000
- Calculation: 20% × ₦3,000,000 = ₦600,000
- **Relief Claimed**: ₦500,000 (capped at maximum)

**Example 3: Very Low Rent**
- Annual Rent: ₦300,000
- Calculation: 20% × ₦300,000 = ₦60,000
